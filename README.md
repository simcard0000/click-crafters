üñ±Ô∏èCS 449 project repository! Now an archive from Fall 2023.

### About the Project
"LinguaFlow" is a language translation app designed to be a tool to connect people of different cultures and enable clear and effective communication. Its goal is to ease frustration and reduce the inefficiencies of existing language translation solutions. By focusing on friendly workflows, LinguaFlow can reduce the anxiety associated with talking to someone who doesn‚Äôt speak the user‚Äôs language.
